1 linux kernel programming
2 networking programming, including application, device,  protocol
3 c++ programming

More than 10 years of network device dev. and study  experiences gives me understanding of network and network devices(broad band gateway, L2/L3 switching, firewall/network flow control, basic knowledge of current and future network etc).  And 6 years of Linux kernel and userspace programming gives me understanding of  software itself(such as linux system, kernel debug,  software performance optimization, basic software design principle) and methods of software developments.
