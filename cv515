A little company which provides high performance firewall and network flow control products(fpga+linux)
Position: linux software team leader
repsonsible for following product:
        user-based and service-based network flow controlling device
        supporting network-flow logging and analysis
        supporting L2 and L3 and 10GE switch
        FPGA+linux based
        
 achievements: improving system's performance、 reliability and development productivity 
        
 1、writing architecture documents for the system and assigning tasks
      Hardware(NIC/switch) driver,  netfilter/session management, nat/alg, dpi, L2/L3 forwarding, configurement, snmp, logging and reportting

 2 linux NIC driver debug(PCIE 10GE) and problem correction 
          such as PCIE register writing error
 3 linux kernel panic and kernel death debugging and problem correction
      such as kernel memory leak, kernel buffer overflow, kernel deadlock
3 performance improvements of packet processing module(l2/l3 switch) in linux kernel by many methods including,
    porting system to X86 64bits-multi-core linux platform
    writing rules to guide the porting
    changing register accessing to DMA
4 software maintainability improvements and daily auto testing of software version(with self-developed tools),  and making the sw development process agile, improving the quality and productivity of sw dev.
5 writing  testing tools which can simulate user of many kinds of internet applications(such as QQ/skype) to replace the old expensive and deficient IXIA testing devices,  
6 instructing others on specific technology.
Achievements: The firewall running on CMCC network produced only one functional bug.
