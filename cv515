A little company which provides high performance firewall and network flow control products(fpga+linux)
Position: linux software team leader

repsonsible for software devolepment of 10GE firewall, following achivements: improvementing system's performance、 reliability and productivity

leading following software parts development: Hardware(NIC/switch) driver,  netfilter/session management, dpi, L2/L3 forwarding, configurement, snmp, logging and reportting

1 linux NIC driver debug(PCIE 10GE) and problem correction 
2 linux kernel panic and kernel death debugging and problem correction
3 performance improvements of packet processing module(l2/l3 switch) in linux kernel by many methods including,
    porting system to X86 64bits-multi-core linux platform)
    wrting documents to guide the porting
4 software maintainability improvements and daily auto testing of software version(with self-developed tools),  and making the sw development process agile, improving the quality and productivity of sw dev.
5 writing  testing tools which can simulate user of many kinds of internet applications(such as QQ/skype) to replace the old expensive and deficient IXIA testing devices,  
6 instructing others on specific technology, leading software dev.
Achievements: The firewall running on CMCC network produced only one functional bug.
